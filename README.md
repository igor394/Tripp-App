Your task is to code and program MVP for managing work trips. The user of
this hypothetical app should be able to:
View upcoming and past trips
Create a new trip
Edit a future trip (past trips must not be editable)
Fetch list of countries via API and populate the "Select country" field

At work, you will encounter and work with these libraries:
Framework: NextJS
Styling: emotion / styled-components
Data fetching: SWR / React Query / Redux-Toolkit with REST API
Forms: react-hook-form
For this project, however, feel free to use any JS/TS library and any framework
of your choosing. The only requirement is that the project must use React.
During development, you may use any tools that will make your work more
comfortable or help the project with its long-term sustainability.
